# LinearRegression
This a detailed explanation of how Linear Expression is calculated.  In this you will see detailed with hand written code and sklearn module used to predict 

I have included even the multi regression with the detailed explanation about which model to use and when to use. Which factor are to be considered for the better performance of the model. Here I have considered the lower the Mean Squared error better the model but considering the overfitting and multicollinearity of the problem. 

There is a multi linear regression having the independent variable as the categorical and other independent variable. In these cases, I prefered to use the handwritten formula instead of using module. I am finding difference in the intercepts and slope. Figuring out where the things are missing.
